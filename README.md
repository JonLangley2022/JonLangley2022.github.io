# Applying Post Prediction Inference to the NFL: How We Strive to Reinvent Sports Analysis
 > A group project by Jonathan Langley, Sujeet Yeramareddy, and Yong Liu
### Introduction

For our 180B project, my group decided to use our domain methodology of postpi (post prediction inference) and apply it to sports analysis based on NFL games.  We are designing a model that can predict the outcome of a football game, such as which team will win and what the margin of their victory will be, and then correcting the statistical inference for selected key features.  The main goals of our investigation is discerning which features most strongly determine the victor of a football game, and subsequently which features provide the most significant means of inferring the margin of that victory.  For example, does the home field advantage give a 50% higher chance of winning by 7 points?  Is the comparative offense to defense rating the most critical factor in securing a win?  Does or does not weather play a statistically significant part in influencing margin of victory?  These are just some of the questions we have brought up and seek to answer during the course of our research, and by conducting this project we are attempting to revolutionize the way NFL analytics are conducted via a more accurate statistical method of inference, postpi.
